              Complex or alternative projects seeking funding from the capital markets can be challenging
              for investors to analyse and fit to their investment criteria. Vanilla debt or equity instruments
              are often not appropriate or viable. Such projects are often also so unique that, when analysed in
              full detail, price is difficult to measure and risk diversification, within the investor’s existing
              portfolio, is difficult to achieve.
