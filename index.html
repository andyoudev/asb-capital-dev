              Complex or alternative projects seeking funding from the capital markets can be challenging
              for investors to analyse and fit to their investment criteria. Vanilla debt or equity instruments
              are often not appropriate or viable. Such projects are often also so unique that, when analysed in
              full detail, price is difficult to measure and risk diversification, within the investor’s existing
              portfolio, is difficult to achieve.

          Asset Backed Securitisation Bonds
        </p>
        <p>
          ASB Capital acts as the Arranger to pool carefully selected assets, which meet our strict criteria, into a securitisation
          vehicle. In order to achieve the desired Capital Arbitrage levels for investors we carefully analyse asset prices and
          quantify portfolio risks which are then modelled against various outcome scenarios. The securitisation vehicles then
          source funds by way of the issuance of high yield bonds in order to provide uniformly defined terms, returns and exits
          for investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          By utilising securitisation as a method of funding structuring we are able to provide investors with a range of risk/reward
          opportunities to suit appetites as well as providing the Originators’ Clients with access to sources of capital at more
          attractive rates and terms than traditional sources may allow.
